### About This Project
1. Nginx is one of the most popular open-source software around the world.It is powerful.However it is not easy to configure.
2. Before I started this project,I had already developed a cmd-line tool to help configuring nginx.But it didn't satisfy me.
3. So I planned to develop a GUI tool to help configuring nginx.
4. Performance requirement is unnecessary in this project,so I planed to develop it based on Electron so that it can cross platform.
5. According to my idea,this project can help people easily create a configuration file for nginx and dealing other things:
    - Help people understand the config file of nginx.A GUI tool with some notice may be a better way for people to learn how to use nginx.
    - Help improving the runtime-performance.
    - Help writing a nginx config file with better security.
6. And I think it would be a better tool if it can run a test on different versions of ngix as soon as the config file is generated.
7. It may be a long way,I hope I could hang on.
8. Thanks for ready and it would be better if you could donate this project.
