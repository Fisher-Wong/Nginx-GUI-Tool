### About This Project
- Nginx is one of the most popular open-source software around the world.It is powerful.However it is not easy to configure.
- Before I started this project,I had already developed a cmd-line tool to help configuring nginx.But it didn't satisfy me.
- So I planned to develop a GUI tool to help configuring nginx.
- Performance requirement is unnecessary in this project,so I planed to develop it based on Electron so that it can cross platform.
- According to my idea,this project can help people easily create a configuration file for nginx and dealing other things:
    - Help people understand the config file of nginx with some notice.
    - Help improving the runtime-performance of nginx.
    - Optimization the nginx config file to get better security.
- And I think it would be a better tool if it can run a test on different versions of ngix as soon as the config file is generated.
- It may be a long way,I hope I could hang on.
- Thanks for ready and it would be better if you could donate this project.
